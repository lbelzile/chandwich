# chandwich 1.0.0.9000

## New features

* `adjust_loglik` has an additional arguments `mle` and `hess_at_mle` that allow the user to supply the MLE and, optionally the Hessian of the negated loglikelihood evaulated at the MLE, rather than estimating these within `adjust_loglik`.

## Bug fixes and minor improvements
